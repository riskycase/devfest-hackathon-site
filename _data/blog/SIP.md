## Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and The Power of Compounding

In a SIP we invest a regular amount of money for a certain period of time, usually monthly into either mutual funds or directly into stocks and with the help of compounding and regular investment we watch our, money grow at an **exponential** rate.

"**Compounding is the Magic of Investing**" said Jim Rogers, the famous American businessman and financial commentator. It is indeed one of the most powerful weapons in an investor's arsenal. The beauty of this concept lies in the fact that it is quite simple to understand. But when you put it into practice, the impact can be immense.

## The Power of Compounding

Mathematically speaking, compounding is defined as, **The increase in the value of an investment**, due to the interest earned on the principal, as well as the accumulated interest.'

Simply put, it is a **strategy** that makes your money work for you. It could be regarded as a powerful tool to grow your wealth. You can use the power of compounding to plan your future goals, such as retirement.

Simple interest means you earn interest on your principal. But with compound interest, you earn interest on the principal amount as well as the accumulated interest amount over successive periods. Over time, this interest snowballs into a substantial amount.

Here's a hypothetical example to highlight the power of compounding.
Vijay and Geeta both invest Rs 50,000 each in an investment avenue that offers an annual interest rate of 10% for 10 years. While Vijay chooses **simple interest**, Geeta opts for **compound interest** (read re-invest).

At the end of 10 years, Vijay would make a total corpus of Rs. **1 lakh**. On the other hand, Geeta would earn a corpus of Rs. **1.30 lakh**.
This is because in Vijay's case, the interest was calculated only on the initial principal amount of Rs. 50,000. But in Geeta's case, the interest earned each year was included along with the principal to calculate the interest for the next year. This helped **increase** her earnings in a big way.

## Benefits The Power of Compounding

One of the biggest benefits that investors can appreciate about the power of compounding is the value of time. With time, you could gain returns, and the yields on these returns could further generate returns; thus, helping to increase your investments **quickly**.

Saving money and earning compound interest amount every year is a good thing. But what if you were to invest a fixed amount each month? This small act could boost your returns over time. Let's find out how that is possible.
When you regularly invest over time, your returns could accumulate at a much faster pace.

Imagine you invest Rs. 5,000 every month. The interest on this amount is 10% per annum. The below table reveals how your investment returns (in Lakhs) would look like over time:

| &nbsp; Years &nbsp; | &nbsp; Expected Amount &nbsp; | &nbsp; Amount Invested &nbsp; | &nbsp; Wealth Gain &nbsp; |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|          5          |              3.9              |               3               |            0.9            |
|         10          |             10.3              |               6               |            4.3            |
|         15          |             20.9              |               9               |           11.9            |
|         20          |             38.3              |              12               |           26.3            |
|         25          |             66.9              |              15               |           51.9            |
|         30          |              114              |              19               |            96             |

The above table is to explain the concept of power of compounding and is shown for illustration and explanatory purposes only.

This example highlights the compounding effect because the wealth gain rises exponentially over five years. At the end of 30 years, the investment capital of Rs. 19 lakhs has grown multiple times to a corpus of Rs. 96 lakhs.

If there is just one takeaway from this example, it can be this:

It is crucial to start saving and investing from an **early age**. And when you do this regularly for an extended period, you stand a chance to **maximize** your returns and benefit from the full power of compounding.

Many people wrongly assume they can begin investing only when they have large sums of money. Therefore they **delay** investing until they are in their mid-forties. This is not a sound investment strategy. On the other hand, when you start investing from an early stage, it doesn't matter how much you can invest. Even if you invest small amounts of money regularly, you can hope to achieve a significant corpus over time.

## Power of Compounding and mutual funds

We have talked about the benefits of investing a fixed amount regularly to benefit from compound interest. But there is a big question to be addressed. Where can an investor put his money to achieve the full benefit of compounding? The answer is **mutual funds**. As an investment avenue, mutual funds are designed in a way to magnify the benefits of compounding. This is possible through **Systematic Investment Plans** (SIPs).

Here's how it works: You can invest a fixed sum in mutual funds regularly through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). This can be monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. You can select the fund of your choice, use an SIP calculator to calculate the return on your investment and make a SIP payment on the allotted date. Investing regularly through SIPs could magnify your returns over time. While you can invest in most fund types through a SIP, you may want to consider investing in equity funds for long-term goals like retirement planning. This is because equity funds have the potential to offer better returns in the long-term.

The best part about SIPs is that you can automate your payments by giving a standing instruction to your bank. You can transfer money from your registered bank account directly to the mutual fund on the specified date. As a result, you don't need to worry about missing payment schedules.
